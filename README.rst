peevee
======

A path validator and transformer, allowing for checking and modification of
input path strings to make them safe for use on various platforms and
filesystems.

This is apparently lacking from the standard library, and doesn't seem
available on PyPI. I've come across a couple of applications which need this
functionality and hack a solution for it with varying degrees of success.
Hopefully, this package will put together a more elegant and flexible
solution.

The name "peevee" comes from the initial letters of "Path" and "Validator",
"PV", which is pronounced "peevee" in English! Also, it sounds similar to the
verb "peeve", which is a verb describing how having to write platform-specific
code makes developers feel!
